# Introduction
### This repository contains my project submission for the Programming and Scripting module as part of the ATU Higher Diploma in Computing in Data Analytics. This project explores the Iris dataset, which was introduced by the statistician Ronald Fisher in 1936 and is often used as a beginner's dataset in data analytics.

# Summary 
#### The Iris dataset consists of three species of Iris flower: Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica.
#### Each sample consists of four features: petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width.
#### In this project, I write a program called analysis.py that:  
#### 1. Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file. 
#### 2. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files.
#### 3. Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
#### 4. Outputs four box plots of each variable.
